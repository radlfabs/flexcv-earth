# flexcv-earth

This is a additional package for the python package [flexcv](https://github.com/radlfabs/flecv).
`flexcv-earth` provides a wrapper class to use Earth model regression in python without the need to install `pyearth`.
Instead, `flexcv-earth` uses the `rpy2` package to call the `earth` function from the `earth` package in R.
